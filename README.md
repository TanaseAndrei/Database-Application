# Database-Application
A simple database application where you can make queries. Made using Postgresql driver.
There are 3 panels in the application:
1. The left one has 3 components, upper text area is for input (writing a query), the second text area is for the result, the third component
and the final one is the button that being pressed will make the query and put the result in the result text area.
2. The middle panel is for databases. There will be all the databases in your connection.
3. The last panel is for tables. By pressing a database in your middle panel, here will be displayed all tables in that database.

Note: This is not finished, the result of the query is not properly displayed; the query action must be reinplemented using SOLID principles;
must rewrite the scaling properties, this will work just for 1920x1080 and a scale of 100%, if one of those changes, then the overall
application will be buggy and look dirty.
